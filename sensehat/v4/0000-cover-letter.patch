This patch series adds a set of drivers for operating the Sense HAT
peripheral device. This board is an add on for the Raspberry Pi that is
designed to connect using the GPIO connector via I2C.

It features:
	- a joystick
	- an 8x8 RGB LED matrix display
	- a whole bunch of environmental sensors with their own drivers
	  (those are already in upstream Linux)

This is a refactor of the work of Serge Schneider, the author of a
version of this driver that is currently in the Raspberry Pi downstream
kernel. We modified his code to make it suitable for upstream Linux.

A couple of tests are available for the driver in this repo:
https://github.com/underground-software/sensehat/tree/master/tests
	- color_test displays various solid colors on the LED panel
	- framebuffer_test diplays a single lit cell that is
	  controllable via the arrow keys or the joystick

Changes since v2:
	- We included a device tree binding in yaml form
	- Switched to regmap for all i2c communications
	- Fixed a few places where we had the old rpisense
	  name that we missed when renaming for v2
