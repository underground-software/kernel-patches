This patch series adds a set of drivers for operating the Sense HAT
peripheral device. This board is an add on for the Raspberry Pi that is
designed to connect using the GPIO connector and communicate via I2C.

It features:
	- a joystick
	- an 8x8 RGB LED matrix display
	- a whole bunch of environmental sensors with their own drivers
	  (those are already in upstream Linux)

This is a refactor of the work of Serge Schneider, the author of a
version of this driver that is currently in the Raspberry Pi downstream
kernel. We modified his code to make it suitable for upstream Linux.

A couple of tests are available for the driver in the test folder in
this repo: https://github.com/underground-software/sensehat.git
	- sensehat_joystick_test logs the input events from the
	  joystick to the console
	- sensehat_display_test displays various solid colors on
	  the LED panel.
	- full_sensehat_test displays a single lit cell that can be
	  moved with the joystick. Pressing the joystick ends the
	  program.

Changes since v8:
	- Fixed a few small things in the device tree bindings.
	I forgot to include the fact that Rob Herring had already
	reviewed them when I posted v8, so Krzysztof Kozlowski
	jumped in and offered his input. The suggestions were good
	so we decided to include them. Sorry for the confusion.
	- Corrected a typo in the description of the display driver.
	The format of the special file used by the driver was changed
	in v8 and this was described in the cover letter of the patch,
	but not in the actual note attached to that patch. This is now
	fixed.
