This patch series adds a set of drivers for operating the Sense HAT
peripheral device. This board is an add on for the Raspberry Pi that is
designed to connect using the GPIO connector via I2C.

It features:
	- a joystick
	- an 8x8 RGB LED matrix display
	- a whole bunch of environmental sensors with their own drivers
	(those are already in upstream Linux)

This is a refactor of the work of Serge Schneider, the author of a
version of this driver that is currently in the Raspberry Pi downstream
kernel. We modified his code to make it suitable for upstream Linux.

A couple of tests are available for the driver in this repo:
https://github.com/underground-software/sensehat/tree/master/tests
	- color_test displays various solid colors on the LED panel
	- framebuffer_test diplays a single lit cell that is
	  controllable via the arrow keys or the joystick

Known issue:
 - We are not sure how to integrate the device tree overlay for the
   Sense HAT into mainline Linux, or if we even should at this time.

Fortunately, most Linux distrubtions that can run on the Raspberry Pi
already include an appropriate device tree overlay since they often import
all of the overlays from the downstream Raspberry Pi kernel.

We have included a hypothetical overlay that would work for the sensehat
as a fourth patch in this series but we just put it in the root of the
source tree for the time being so that patch should not be merged unless a
consensus is reached that the overlay should be in the tree, and a proper
location is found to put it.

Suggestions are welcome and appreciated.

Changes since v1:
 - We included a device tree overlay for the Sense HAT
 - Based on Feedback from v1 we:
  - Changed the style of a few lines
  - Adding more error logging
  - Changed the compatible strings to use the more common
    "raspberrypi" instead of just "rpi"
  - Renamed everything from rpisense to sensehat
