This patch series adds a set of drivers for operating the Sense HAT
peripheral device. This board is an add on for the Raspberry Pi that is
designed to connect using the GPIO connector and communicate via I2C.

It features:
	- a joystick
	- an 8x8 RGB LED matrix display
	- a whole bunch of environmental sensors with their own drivers
	  (those are already in upstream Linux)

This is a refactor of the work of Serge Schneider, the author of a
version of this driver that is currently in the Raspberry Pi downstream
kernel. We modified his code to make it suitable for upstream Linux.

A couple of tests are available for the driver in the test folder in
this repo: https://github.com/underground-software/sensehat.git
	- sensehat_joystick_test logs the input events from the
	  joystick to the console
	- sensehat_display_test displays various solid colors on
	  the LED panel.
	- full_sensehat_test displays a single lit cell that can be
	  moved with the joystick. Pressing the joystick ends the
	  program.

Changes since v9:
	- The driver for the sensehat joystick was accepted upstream so
	  it is no longer included in this patchset.
	- Some of the people involved in the development of earlier
	  versions of these patches are no longer involved in the project
	  so they have been removed from the list of maintainers and the
	  patches.
	- The code is completely unchanged and so based on the discussions
	  from version 9 of the patches, it should be ready to be merged.

My appologies for the long delay between v9 and v10 especially given the
fact that there are no changes to the code. We appreciate the maintainers'
patience and guidance throughout all 10 versions of this sensehat patchset,
and we are excited for this driver to hopefully be fully accepted.

Best - Charlie
